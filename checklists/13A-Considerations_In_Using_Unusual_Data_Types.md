# Considerations In Using Unusual Data Types

## Structures

- [ ] Have you used structures instead of naked variables to organize and manipulate groups of related data?
- [ ] Have you considered creating a class as an alternative to using a structure?

## Global Data

- [ ] Are all variables local or class-scope unless they absolutely need to be global?
- [ ] Do variable naming conventions differentiate among local, class, and global data?
- [ ] Are all global variables documented?
- [ ] Is the code free of pseudoglobal data-mammoth objects containing a mishmash of data that's passed to every routine?
- [ ] Are access routines used instead of global data?
- [ ] Are access routines and data organized into classes?
- [ ] Do access routines provide a level of abstraction beyond the underlying data-type implementations?
- [ ] Are all related access routines at the same level of abstraction?

## Pointers

- [ ] Are pointer operations isolated in routines?
- [ ] Are pointer references valid, or could the pointer be dangling?
- [ ] Does the code check pointers for validity before using them?
- [ ] Is the variable that the pointer references checked for validity before it's used?
- [ ] Are pointers set to NULL after they're freed?
- [ ] Does the code use all the pointer variables needed for the sake of readability?
- [ ] Are pointers in linked lists freed in the right order?
- [ ] Does the program allocate a reserve parachute of memory so that it can shut down gracefully if it runs out of memory?
- [ ] Are pointers used only as a last resort, when no other method is available?
