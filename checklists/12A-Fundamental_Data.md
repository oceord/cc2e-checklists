# Fundamental Data

## Numbers in General

- [ ] Does the code avoid magic numbers?
- [ ] Does the code anticipate divide-by-zero errors?
- [ ] Are type conversions obvious?
- [ ] If variables with two different types are used in the same expression, will the expression be evaluated as you intend it to be?
- [ ] Does the code avoid mixed-type comparisons?
- [ ] Does the program compile with no warnings?

## Integers

- [ ] Do expressions that use integer division work the way they're meant to?
- [ ] Do integer expressions avoid integer-overflow problems?

## Floating-Point Numbers

- [ ] Does the code avoid additions and subtractions on numbers with greatly different magnitudes?
- [ ] Does the code systematically prevent rounding errors?
- [ ] Does the code avoid comparing floating-point numbers for equality?

## Characters and Strings

- [ ] Does the code avoid magic characters and strings?
- [ ] Are references to strings free of off-by-one errors?
- [ ] Does C code treat string pointers and character arrays differently?
- [ ] Does C code follow the convention of declaring strings to be length constant+1?
- [ ] Does C code use arrays of characters rather than pointers, when appropriate?
- [ ] Does C code initialize strings to NULLs to avoid endless strings?
- [ ] Does C code use strncpy() rather than strcpy()? And strncat() and strncmp()?

## Boolean Variables

- [ ] Does the program use additional boolean variables to document conditional tests?
- [ ] Does the program use additional boolean variables to simplify conditional tests?

## Enumerated Types

- [ ] Does the program use enumerated types instead of named constants for their improved readability, reliability, and modifiability?
- [ ] Does the program use enumerated types instead of boolean variables when a variable's use cannot be completely captured with TRUE and FALSE?
- [ ] Do tests using enumerated types test for invalid values?
- [ ] Is the first entry in an enumerated type reserved for “invalid”?

## Named Constants

- [ ] Does the program use named constants for data declarations and loop limits rather than magic numbers?
- [ ] Have named constants been used consistently—not named constants in some places, literals in others?

## Arrays

- [ ] Are all array indexes within the bounds of the array?
- [ ] Are array references free of off-by-one errors?
- [ ] Are all subscripts on multidimensional arrays in the correct order?
- [ ] In nested loops, is the correct variable used as the array subscript, avoiding loop-index cross talk?

## Creating Types

- [ ] Does the program use a different type for each kind of data that might change?
- [ ] Are type names oriented toward the real-world entities the types represent rather than toward programming- language types?
- [ ] Are the type names descriptive enough to help document data declarations?
- [ ] Have you avoided redefining predefined types?
- [ ] Have you considered creating a new class rather than simply redefining a type?
