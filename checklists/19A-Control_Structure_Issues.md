# Control Structure Issues

- [ ] Do expressions use True and False rather than 1 and 0?
- [ ] Are boolean values compared to True and False implicitly?
- [ ] Are numeric values compared to their test values explicitly?
- [ ] Have expressions been simplified by the addition of new boolean variables and the use of boolean functions and decision tables?
- [ ] Are boolean expressions stated positively?
- [ ] Do pairs of braces balance?
- [ ] Are braces used everywhere they're needed for clarity?
- [ ] Are logical expressions fully parenthesized?
- [ ] Have tests been written in number-line order?
- [ ] Do Java tests uses a.equals(b) style instead of a == b when appropriate?
- [ ] Are null statements obvious?
- [ ] Have nested statements been simplified by retesting part of the conditional, converting to if-then-else or case statements, moving nested code into its own routine, converting to a more object-oriented design, or improved in some other way?
- [ ] If a routine has a decision count of more than 10, is there a good reason for not redesigning it?
