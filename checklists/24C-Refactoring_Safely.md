# Refactoring Safely

- [ ] Is each change part of a systematic change strategy?
- [ ] Did you save the code you started with before beginning refactoring?
- [ ] Are you keeping each refactoring small?
- [ ] Are you doing refactorings one at a time?
- [ ] Have you made a list of steps you intend to take during your refactoring?
- [ ] Do you have a parking lot so that you can remember ideas that occur to you mid-refactoring?
- [ ] Have you retested after each refactoring?
- [ ] Have changes been reviewed if they are complicated or if they affect mission-critical code?
- [ ] Have you considered the riskiness of the specific refactoring, and adjusted your approach accordingly?
- [ ] Does the change enhance the program's internal quality rather than degrading it?
- [ ] Have you avoided using refactoring as a cover for code and fix or as an excuse for not rewriting bad code?
