# Reasons to Refactor

- [ ] Code is duplicated
- [ ] A routine is too long
- [ ] A loop is too long or too deeply nested
- [ ] A class has poor cohesion
- [ ] A class interface does not provide a consistent level of abstraction
- [ ] A parameter list has too many parameters
- [ ] Changes within a class tend to be compartmentalized
- [ ] Changes require parallel modifications to multiple classes
- [ ] Inheritance hierarchies have to be modified in parallel
- [ ] Related data items that are used together are not organized into classes
- [ ] A routine uses more features of another class than of its own class
- [ ] A primitive data type is overloaded
- [ ] A class doesn't do very much
- [ ] A chain of routines passes tramp data
- [ ] A middle man object isn't doing anything
- [ ] One class is overly intimate with another
- [ ] A routine has a poor name
- [ ] Data members are public
- [ ] A subclass uses only a small percentage of its parents' routines
- [ ] Comments are used to explain difficult code
- [ ] Global variables are used
- [ ] A routine uses setup code before a routine call or takedown code after a routine call
- [ ] A program contains code that seems like it might be needed someday
