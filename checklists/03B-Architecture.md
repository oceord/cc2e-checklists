# Architecture

## Specific Architectural Topics

- [ ] Is the overall organization of the program clear, including a good architectural overview and justification?
- [ ] Are major building blocks well defined, including their areas of responsibility and their interfaces to other building blocks?
- [ ] Are all the functions listed in the requirements covered sensibly, by neither too many nor too few building blocks?
- [ ] Are the most critical classes described and justified?
- [ ] Is the data design described and justified?
- [ ] Is the database organization and content specified?
- [ ] Are all key business rules identified and their impact on the system described?
- [ ] Is a strategy for the user interface design described?
- [ ] Is the user interface modularized so that changes in it won't affect the rest of the program?
- [ ] Is a strategy for handling I/O described and justified?
- [ ] Are resource-use estimates and a strategy for resource management described and justified?
- [ ] Are the architecture's security requirements described?
- [ ] Does the architecture set space and speed budgets for each class, subsystem, or functionality area?
- [ ] Does the architecture describe how scalability will be achieved?
- [ ] Does the architecture address interoperability?
- [ ] Is a strategy for internationalization/localization described?
- [ ] Is a coherent error-handling strategy provided?
- [ ] Is the approach to fault tolerance defined (if any is needed)?
- [ ] Has technical feasibility of all parts of the system been established?
- [ ] Is an approach to overengineering specified?
- [ ] Are necessary buy-vs.-build decisions included?
- [ ] Does the architecture describe how reused code will be made to conform to other architectural objectives?
- [ ] Is the architecture designed to accommodate likely changes?

## General Architectural Quality

- [ ] Does the architecture account for all the requirements?
- [ ] Is any part over- or under-architected? Are expectations in this area set out explicitly?
- [ ] Does the whole architecture hang together conceptually?
- [ ] Is the top-level design independent of the machine and language that will be used to implement it?
- [ ] Are the motivations for all major decisions provided?
- [ ] Are you, as a programmer who will implement the system, comfortable with the architecture?
