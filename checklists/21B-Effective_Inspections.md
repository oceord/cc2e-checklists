# Effective Inspections

- [ ] Do you have checklists that focus reviewer attention on areas that have been problems in the past?
- [ ] Is the emphasis on defect detection rather than correction?
- [ ] Are inspectors given enough time to prepare before the inspection meeting, and is each one prepared?
- [ ] Does each participant have a distinct role to play?
- [ ] Does the meeting move at a productive rate?
- [ ] Is the meeting limited to two hours?
- [ ] Has the moderator received specific training in conducting inspections?
- [ ] Is data about error types collected at each inspection so that you can tailor future checklists to your organization?
- [ ] Is data about preparation and inspection rates collected so that you can optimize future preparation and inspections?
- [ ] Are the action items assigned at each inspection followed up, either personally by the moderator or with a re-inspection?
- [ ] Does management understand that it should not attend inspection meetings?
