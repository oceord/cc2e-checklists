# Loops

## Loop Selection and Creation

- [ ] Is a while loop used instead of a for loop, if appropriate?
- [ ] Was the loop created from the inside out?

## Entering the Loop

- [ ] Is the loop entered from the top?
- [ ] Is initialization code directly before the loop?
- [ ] If the loop is an infinite loop or an event loop, is it constructed cleanly rather than using a kludge such as for i = 1 to 9999?
- [ ] If the loop is a C++, C, or Java for loop, is the loop header reserved for loop-control code?

## Inside the Loop

- [ ] Does the loop use { and } or their equivalent to prevent problems arising from improper modifications?
- [ ] Does the loop body have something in it? Is it nonempty?
- [ ] Are housekeeping chores grouped, at either the beginning or the end of the loop?
- [ ] Does the loop perform one and only one function—as a well-defined routine does?
- [ ] Is the loop short enough to view all at once?
- [ ] Is the loop nested to three levels or less?
- [ ] Have long loop contents been moved into their own routine?
- [ ] If the loop is long, is it especially clear?

## Loop Indexes

- [ ] If the loop is a for loop, does the code inside it avoid monkeying with the loop index?
- [ ] Is a variable used to save important loop-index values rather than using the loop index outside the loop?
- [ ] Is the loop index an ordinal type or an enumerated type—not floating point?
- [ ] Does the loop index have a meaningful name?
- [ ] Does the loop avoid index cross talk?

## Exiting the Loop

- [ ] Does the loop end under all possible conditions?
- [ ] Does the loop use safety counters—if you've instituted a safety-counter standard?
- [ ] Is the loop's termination condition obvious?
- [ ] If break or continue are used, are they correct?
