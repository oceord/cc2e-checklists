# Effective Pair Programming

- [ ] Do you have a coding standard to support pair programming that's focused on programming rather than on philosophical coding-style discussions?
- [ ] Are both partners participating actively?
- [ ] Are you avoiding pair programming everything, instead selecting the assignments that will really benefit from pair programming?
- [ ] Are you rotating pair assignments and work assignments regularly?
- [ ] Are the pairs well matched in terms of pace and personality?
- [ ] Is there a team leader to act as the focal point for management and other people outside the project?
