# Programming Tools

- [ ] Do you have an effective IDE?
- [ ] Does your IDE support outline view of your program; jumping to definitions of classes, routines, and variables; source code formatting; brace matching or begin-end matching; multiple file string search and replace; convenient compilation; and integrated debugging?
- [ ] Do you have tools that automate common refactorings?
- [ ] Are you using version control to manage source code, content, requirements, designs, project plans, and other project artifacts?
- [ ] If you're working on a very large project, are you using a data dictionary or some other central repository that contains authoritative descriptions of each class used in the system?
- [ ] Have you considered code libraries as alternatives to writing custom code, where available?
- [ ] Are you making use of an interactive debugger?
- [ ] Do you use make or other dependency-control software to build programs efficiently and reliably?
- [ ] Does your test environment include an automated test framework, automated test generators, coverage monitors, system disruptors, diff tools, and defect tracking software?
- [ ] Have you created any custom tools that would help support your specific project's needs, especially tools that automate repetitive tasks?
- [ ] Overall, does your environment benefit from adequate tool support?
