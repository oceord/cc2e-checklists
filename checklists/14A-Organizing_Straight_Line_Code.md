# Organizing Straight Line Code

- [ ] Does the code make dependencies among statements obvious?
- [ ] Do the names of routines make dependencies obvious?
- [ ] Do parameters to routines make dependencies obvious?
- [ ] Do comments describe any dependencies that would otherwise be unclear?
- [ ] Have housekeeping variables been used to check for sequential dependencies in critical sections of code?
- [ ] Does the code read from top to bottom?
- [ ] Are related statements grouped together?
- [ ] Have relatively independent groups of statements been moved into their own routines?
