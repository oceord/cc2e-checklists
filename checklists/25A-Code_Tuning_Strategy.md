# Code-Tuning Strategy

## Overall Program Performance

- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by changing the program requirements?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by modifying the program's design?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by modifying the class design?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by avoiding operating system interactions?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by avoiding I/O?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by using a compiled language instead of an interpreted language?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by using compiler optimizations?
- [ ] Have you considered improving performance by switching to different hardware?
- [ ] Have you considered code tuning only as a last resort?

## Code-Tuning Approach

- [ ] Is your program fully correct before you begin code tuning?
- [ ] Have you measured performance bottlenecks before beginning code tuning?
- [ ] Have you measured the effect of each code-tuning change?
- [ ] Have you backed out the code-tuning changes that didn't produce the intended improvement?
- [ ] Have you tried more than one change to improve performance of each bottleneck, i.e., iterated?
