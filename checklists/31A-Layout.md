# Layout

## General

- [ ] Is formatting done primarily to illuminate the logical structure of the code?
- [ ] Can the formatting scheme be used consistently?
- [ ] Does the formatting scheme result in code that's easy to maintain?
- [ ] Does the formatting scheme improve code readability?

## Control Structures

- [ ] Does the code avoid doubly indented begin-end or {} pairs?
- [ ] Are sequential blocks separated from each other with blank lines?
- [ ] Are complicated expressions formatted for readability?
- [ ] Are single-statement blocks formatted consistently?
- [ ] Are case statements formatted in a way that's consistent with the formatting of other control structures?
- [ ] Have gotos been formatted in a way that makes their use obvious?

## Individual Statements

- [ ] Is white space used to make logical expressions, array references, and routine arguments readable?
- [ ] Do incomplete statements end the line in a way that's obviously incorrect?
- [ ] Are continuation lines indented the standard indentation amount?
- [ ] Does each line contain at most one statement?
- [ ] Is each statement written without side effects?
- [ ] Is there at most one data declaration per line?

## Comments

- [ ] Are the comments indented the same number of spaces as the code they comment?
- [ ] Is the commenting style easy to maintain?

## Routines

- [ ] Are the arguments to each routine formatted so that each argument is easy to read, modify, and comment?
- [ ] Are blank lines used to separate parts of a routine?

## Classes, Files and Programs

- [ ] Is there a one-to-one relationship between classes and files for most classes and files?
- [ ] If a file does contain multiple classes, are all the routines in each class grouped together and is the class clearly identified?
- [ ] Are routines within a file clearly separated with blank lines?
- [ ] In lieu of a stronger organizing principle, are all routines in alphabetical sequence?
