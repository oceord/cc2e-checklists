# Debugging Reminders

## Techniques for Finding Defects

- [ ] Use all the data available to make your hypothesis
- [ ] Refine the test cases that produce the error
- [ ] Exercise the code in your unit test suite
- [ ] Use available tools
- [ ] Reproduce the error several different ways
- [ ] Generate more data to generate more hypotheses
- [ ] Use the results of negative tests
- [ ] Brainstorm for possible hypotheses
- [ ] Narrow the suspicious region of the code
- [ ] Be suspicious of classes and routines that have had defects before
- [ ] Check code thats changed recently
- [ ] Expand the suspicious region of the code
- [ ] Integrate incrementally
- [ ] Check for common defects
- [ ] Talk to someone else about the problem
- [ ] Take a break from the problem
- [ ] Set a maximum time for quick and dirty debugging
- [ ] Make a list of brute force techniques, and use them

## Techniques for Syntax Errors

- [ ] Don't trust line numbers in compiler messages
- [ ] Don't trust compiler messages
- [ ] Don't trust the compilers second message
- [ ] Divide and conquer
- [ ] Find extra comments and quotation marks

## Techniques for Fixing Defects

- [ ] Understand the problem before you fix it
- [ ] Understand the program, not just the problem
- [ ] Confirm the defect diagnosis
- [ ] Relax
- [ ] Save the original source code
- [ ] Fix the problem, not the symptom
- [ ] Change the code only for good reason
- [ ] Make one change at a time
- [ ] Check your fix
- [ ] Look for similar defects

## General Approach to Debugging

- [ ] Do you use debugging as an opportunity to learn more about your program, mistakes, code quality, and problem-solving approach?
- [ ] Do you avoid the trial-and-error, superstitious approach to debugging?
- [ ] Do you assume that errors are your fault?
- [ ] Do you use the scientific method to stabilize intermittent errors?
- [ ] Do you use the scientific method to find defects?
- [ ] Rather than using the same approach every time, do you use several different techniques to find defects?
- [ ] Do you verify that the fix is correct?
- [ ] Do you use compiler warning messages, execution profiling, a test framework, scaffolding, and interactive debugging?
