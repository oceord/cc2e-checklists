# Good Commenting Technique

## General

- [ ] Can someone pick up the code and immediately start to understand it?
- [ ] Do comments explain the code's intent or summarize what the code does, rather than just repeating the code?
- [ ] Is the Pseudocode Programming Process used to reduce commenting time?
- [ ] Has tricky code been rewritten rather than commented?
- [ ] Are comments up to date?
- [ ] Are comments clear and correct?
- [ ] Does the commenting style allow comments to be easily modified?

## Statements and Paragraphs

- [ ] Does the code avoid endline comments?
- [ ] Do comments focus on why rather than how?
- [ ] Do comments prepare the reader for the code to follow?
- [ ] Does every comment count? Have redundant, extraneous, and self-indulgent comments been removed or improved?
- [ ] Are surprises documented?
- [ ] Have abbreviations been avoided?
- [ ] Is the distinction between major and minor comments clear?
- [ ] Is code that works around an error or undocumented feature commented?

## Data Declarations

- [ ] Are units on data declarations commented?
- [ ] Are the ranges of values on numeric data commented?
- [ ] Are coded meanings commented?
- [ ] Are limitations on input data commented?
- [ ] Are flags documented to the bit level?
- [ ] Has each global variable been commented where it is declared?
- [ ] Has each global variable been identified as such at each usage, by a naming convention, a comment, or both?
- [ ] Are magic numbers replaced with named constants or variables rather than just documented?

## Control Structures

- [ ] Is each control statement commented?
- [ ] Are the ends of long or complex control structures commented or, when possible, simplified so that they don't need comments?

## Routines

- [ ] Is the purpose of each routine commented?
- [ ] Are other facts about each routine given in comments, when relevant, including input and output data, interface assumptions, limitations, error corrections, global effects, and sources of algorithms?

## Files, Classes, and Programs

- [ ] Does the program have a short document such as that described in the Book Paradigm that gives an overall view of how the program is organized?
- [ ] Is the purpose of each file described?
- [ ] Are the author's name, email address, and phone number in the listing?
